## About

This repository contains my personal solutions to the web development challenges provided by Frontend Mentor. Each challenge is designed to improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. I have structured the repository so each challenge is in its own folder with all necessary files and documentation.

## Challenges

Challenge Name	Demo	Solution	Technologies
Challenge 1	Live Demo	Solution	HTML, CSS
Challenge 2	Live Demo	Solution	HTML, CSS, JS
Challenge 3	Live Demo	Solution	HTML, CSS, React
...	...	...	...
For a complete list of challenges and their details, check the Challenges file.

## Installation

To run the solutions locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/frontend-mentor-challenges.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend-mentor-challenges
Install dependencies (if required, typically for JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue):
bash
Copy code
npm install

## Usage

Each challenge is located in its own folder named after the challenge. You can navigate to a challenge's folder and open the index.html file in your browser to see the solution.

Example:

bash
Copy code
cd challenge-name
open index.html
For challenges using frameworks or build tools, follow the instructions in their specific folders. Usually, this involves running a development server with commands like:

bash
Copy code
npm start
